PiJ 2025/26 code samples

## Day 1 - Day 4

We haven't seen packages yet, so all code will be in the "default package".
This also means that it cannot be imported.

+ Use src/Day01, src/Day02, ... as "sources root" for the given code in IntelliJ.
 
+ Use src/Day01Solutions, src/Day02Solutions, ... as "sources root" for the
solution proposals.

## Day 6 - Day 11

Now that we know how to put our own code into packages, we no longer have to
worry about clashes between the names of classes that we write on different
days.

+ Use src/Day06, src/Day07, ... as "sources root" for both the given code and the
solution proposals.

+ Given code is in packages pij.day06, pij.day07, ...

+ Solutions are in packages pij.day06solutions, pij.day07solutions, ...

+ The specific mapping of reading material / slides / exercises to packages is given
in files src/Day06/pij/day06/README.md, src/Day07/pij/day07/README.md, ...

## Day 12 - ...

As for Day 6 - Day 11, except that:

+ Use src/Day12/main, src/Day13/main, ... as "sources root" for both the given
code and the solution proposals.

+ Use src/Day12/test, src/Day13/test, ... as "test sources root" in IntelliJ.
